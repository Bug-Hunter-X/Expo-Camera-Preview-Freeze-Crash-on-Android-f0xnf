This bug occurs when using the Expo Camera API with certain Android devices.  The camera preview might freeze or become unresponsive after a few seconds, and the app might eventually crash. This issue doesn't consistently reproduce across all devices, making debugging difficult.  It seems to be related to memory management or resource contention within the Expo Camera component itself, triggered by specific hardware configurations or usage patterns.
