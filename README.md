# Expo Camera Preview Freeze/Crash on Android

This repository demonstrates a bug where the Expo Camera preview freezes and eventually crashes on certain Android devices. The issue is intermittent and difficult to reproduce consistently.  The bug.js file contains a simplified example illustrating the problem. The bugSolution.js file offers a potential workaround (though not a guaranteed fix). 

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the app on a physical Android device (the issue may not occur on emulators).
3. Observe the camera preview. The preview may freeze after a few seconds, leading to an app crash.

## Potential Causes

* Memory management issues within the Expo Camera component.
* Resource contention on certain Android hardware configurations.
* Asynchronous operations within the camera API handling.

## Workaround (bugSolution.js)

The potential workaround involves adding mechanisms to release resources more aggressively when the camera isn't actively in use, or adjusting the camera settings to reduce processing load.  This is not a definitive solution but a mitigation strategy.

## Note

The exact cause of this bug and a universally effective solution require further investigation and may depend on the specific Android devices and their configurations.
